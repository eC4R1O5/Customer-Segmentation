## **Background: Understanding the Drivers Behind Customer Churn**

Customer churn is a critical indicator of customer satisfaction, competitive dynamics, and long-term profitability. However, effective churn analysis goes beyond tracking churn rates; it requires uncovering the behavioral, transactional, and demographic factors that drive customer attrition. This dashboard integrates key performance metrics, calculated columns, and interactive visualizations to explore **who is leaving, why they are leaving, and what can be done to retain them**.

By identifying churn patterns across different customer segments and usage behaviors, the dashboard provides actionable insights to support strategic decision-making in marketing, customer success, and product development.
